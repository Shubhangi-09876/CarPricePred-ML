# CarPricePred-ML
Built ML model to predict used car prices using Python &amp; Scikit-learn. Performed data cleaning, encoding, EDA and feature engineering. Implemented Linear Regression, evaluated with R2 &amp; RMSE, and visualized actual vs predicted trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn to generate analytics-ready insights.
